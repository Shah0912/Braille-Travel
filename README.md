# Braille-Travel
Braille-Travel was created with a view to help visually impaired people to travel freely from one place to another.
When the user opens the app the user is asked for two inputs the source and the destination.
Both can be given using a button which enables speech to text. Then this is confirmed back with the user using a text to speech engine.
Then the user has two options either he can book an uber or get directions between the two locations.
